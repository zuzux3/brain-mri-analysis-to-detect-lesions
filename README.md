# Brain MRI Analysis to detect lesions

*Project was done as a final project for Bachelor's degree at Bydgoszcz University of Life Sciences and Technology!*

Used libraries:
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Torchvision
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Zipfile
- Gradio
- OpenCV
- Pillow

## Use of libraries

### PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Torchvision
Libraries were used for creating, training and testing transfer learning models.

#### Used models
In the project there are six models used in total:
1) ResNet18
2) ResNet50
3) ResNet101
4) ResNet152
5) VGG16
6) VGG19

### Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Libraries were used for plotting and creating examples of images in the dataset.

### Numpy
Library was used as an aid for the plotting and provided more specific data types for the program, like **Numpy Array**.

### Zipfile
Library was used to unpack zipped data downloaded from kaggle.

### Gradio
Library was used to create software demo UI.

### OpenCV, Pillow
Libraries were used for image-specific tasks, like handling Grad-CAM.


## Dataset used
Dataset used was collected by Sartaj Bhuvaji, Ankita Kadam, Prajakta Bhumkar, Sameer Dedge.
